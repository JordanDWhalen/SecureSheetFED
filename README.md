# UG Gulp Starter
The standard starter template for UG development projects.

## To use this package:
- Go to the "Downloads" tab on the left
- Click "Download Repository"
- Move the .zip version of the repository to wherever you'd like to use it.
- Uncompress the repo.

### If you're setting up a fresh version of the repo for development, otherwise skip to "Building":
- Rename the folder to match your project name.
- Open up package.json and update the name, as well as the version number so that they match your project.

### Building
- Open Terminal.
- Find the folder you just uncompressed, and drag it on to the Terminal icon in the dock.
- In Terminal, type: sudo npm install
- You're most likely going to be prompted to enter the password you use to log into your computer. All this does is give the terminal the permission to install the appropriate files for compression.
- Once that process finishes, type "gulp" in the terminal window, and you're all set up!

- [Flatten](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-flatten): Makes messing with file directorys and paths a little simpler.
- [Imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin): Compresses image files so they load faster, and dont take up so much space on the server.
- [CSS Globbing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-css-globbing): Allows you to reference directories in your Application.scss file, preventing you from having to include every new scss file.

## Options
- Locally running WebServer
  - If you'd like to perform any testing on a device other than the one you're running gulp on:
    1. Navigate to gulpfile.js.
    2. Go to line 76.
    3. Uncomment, and set the host field to "0.0.0.0".
    4. Open up on your mobile device, or any other device connected to the same wifi network the computer you're running gulp is being on.
    5. Enter your IP Address, along with the port number you see in the terminal as the address.
