        <p><strong>SecureSheet</strong> <i>Technologies</i>, LLC, a leading provider of multi-user Compensation spreadsheet and web database solutions, today announced that NCH has successfully streamlined and improved their year-end merit process with <a href="#">SecureSheet</a> for 4 years running.</p>
        <p><em>Karen</em> Murdoch, NCH Compensation: "We have used SecureSheet for Merit Planning for the past four years. Previously our Merit planning process was very cumbersome with over 130 individual spreadsheets and an antiquated email approval process. The one Master file with SecureSheet has tremendously improved the end-user experience. Changes can be made almost instantaneously. SecureSheet is very user-friendly - we have Managers to the CEO accessing the site with very few inquiries. The support we receive from the SecureSheet team is outstanding. The team is very responsive, with questions and requests answered in a very timely manner. SecureSheet has vastly improved our Merit Planning process."</p>
